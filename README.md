# theme-extractor

AI-ready Python package to benchmark multiple theme/topic extraction strategies on heterogeneous corpora.

## CLI
Use one unified CLI with subcommands:
- `theme-extractor ingest`
- `theme-extractor extract`
- `theme-extractor benchmark`

Current phase exposes stable command contracts and raw JSON outputs.

## Current State
This repository currently provides:
- agent governance and delivery skills
- phase 1 architecture contracts
- one unified CLI with subcommands
- normalized JSON output schemas (topic-first, with optional document-topic links)
