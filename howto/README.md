# How-To Guides

This folder contains practical command recipes to run the package end-to-end.

- `ingest.md`: build an ingestion output from local files.
- `extract.md`: run one extraction strategy and interpret the output.
- `benchmark.md`: compare multiple strategies and choose a candidate.
- `report.md`: generate and read markdown reports from JSON outputs.
- `docker-local.md`: start/stop local Elasticsearch or OpenSearch stacks.
- `troubleshooting.md`: common issues and practical fixes.

All commands are executed from the project root.
